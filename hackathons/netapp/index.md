# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

## What is the problem?
Find the usable data entries.
## Why is the problem importnat?
Because it can reduce the cost of system.

## What dataset has been made available?
Deltatime, obersvatoin time, base time and etc

## What specific questions are being raised?
Because in the dataset, there are some unusable entries, they will influence on the output. We need to distinguish the usable ones with unusable ones.

# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

## How was the system expected to report the data? (every 24 hours, or star from a specific time?)
The period is almost 24 hours, and the base time would be reset each time.
## Where the time came from? And are they standardize?
Probably from the United States and Europe, and they are definitely not standardized.
## 


# Approach

Based on the information you've obtained during the Q/A session, come up with
plan how your team will tackle this problem.

## How should the dataset be imported into Tableau?
csv

## How should the work be distributed among the team members?
Divide the questions equally.

## What types of charts or visualizations to use to support the answer?
Bar charts.

## What questions may be too complex for Tableau and may require custom scripts to be written?
