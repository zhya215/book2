# What is the distribution of the most common delta times per bin?

Each bin is of size 80,000
# What are the outliers when comparing max and min delta times?

# Which release did the worst job?

# Are delta times consistent across serial numbers?

# Further Analysis

Our team determines the following questions are too complex for Tableau and
require custom scripts to be written.

* (Pick out the system serial numbers that have useable data and return the ones that have consistently accurate data)
* Determine an error range for acceptable delta times to indicate whether a system is reporting according to standards or not.
* Determine the proportion of usable delta time in each release.
* Determine the trend of delta times over time for specific systems
* Determine the cause of poor delta times, whether it be the release, FW version, SW version or controllers
